This is a simple and interactive investment-based game where players can select numbers, increment or decrement their investment, and then draw a lucky number. If the selected number matches the lucky number, the player wins a multiple of their investment.

Key Features:

Lucky Number Draw: A random lucky number is drawn, and if it matches any of the player's selected numbers, they win a prize (calculated as their investment multiplied by 9).
Dynamic UI: As players interact with the game, their number selections are highlighted. The lucky number box turns deep green to indicate the lucky draw.
Investment Tracking: The total investment and win/loss calculations are displayed based on the player's selected numbers and the lucky number drawn.
